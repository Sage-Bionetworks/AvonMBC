##To Do

Sep 21.
-Training new grants from existing old grants (supervised learning)

-Use existing annotations and match terms: terms that appear in the grant must be a certain topic... (most rudimentary) 

-what is the input feature, and what is the output

-Have a dictionary, add the already annotated to this dictionary, then build upon this dictionary slowly.  
    -target foo:  terms associated with target foo
    -pathway foo : terms associated with pathway foo

- Normalize annotations, and grants then try matching script again
- Boolean categorization of whether an annotation exists or not, then map specific annotation term to the grant (ie, pathway exists or is NA)
	-Need to see decide which algorithm to use to do the boolean classification 
- See how many annotations are labeled as multiple or have multiple
- Email Lynn for more data and ask what the "n/a","-", "other","not specified mean"
